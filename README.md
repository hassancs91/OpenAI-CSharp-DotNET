Call OpenAI API (GPT3) From a .NET C# Application And Generate Text

# I decided To Ask The AI, What will happen in 2030?!
I created a tiny .Net C# console app and Connected it with OpenAI GPT-3 to ask it any question!
What is Open AI?

OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company. and they recently gave access to their API so any developed can benefit from their powerful AI models
in real life projects.

# Why C# .NET and not Python?

If you worked before with Open AI API, you might have noticed that it is super easy to get the code in Python and use it in your scripts. So I wanted to add a small benefit and show how you can integrate OpenAI with .NET apps, as I didnâ€™t find clear and straightforward tutorials about this topic while doing my research.

Here is the Detailed Step By Step Video, if you like to follow up and learn how I created the project:
